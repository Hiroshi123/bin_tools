# bin_tools

misc for reverse engineering.

1.bipatch (binary patch command)

2.objtest (execution for functions in a pre-linked object format flle)

3.callgen (call_graph_generation)

4.jvmtl (java dynamic analysis using jvmti)

## Aim

It was designed from my necessity to understand a binary file which does not have any source code efficiently.
