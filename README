# bin_tools

misc for reverse engineering.

1. bipatch (binary patch command)
   Not yet solid documentation.
2. ld(d) (a linker which is intended for anti-malicious staff)
   Its documentation is on wiki(https://github.com/Hiroshi123/bin_tools/wiki/ldd-specification).
4. debug (my debugger which can be linked by ld(d))

---

Duplicated and no longer maintained commands
objtest (execution for functions in a pre-linked object format flle)
callgen (call_graph_generation) 

## Aim

It was designed from my necessity to understand a binary file which does not have any source code efficiently.
